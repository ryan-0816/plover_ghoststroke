Ghoststroke is a Plover plugin where, if a certain stroke is not found in a dictionary, it will run it through other criteria to output text.

For example, currently it is set up so that "-FP" appends a period to the end of a word.

TKPWAEUFP → gay.

However, this only works if the chord "TKPWAEUFP" is not found in any dictionary while "TKPWAEU" is.

Other examples:

PHOR/PWEUD → morbid

PHOR/PWEUFPD → morbid.

WOUT → without

WOUFPT → without.

Still a work in progress!
