Ghoststroke is a Plover plugin where, if a certain stroke is not found in a dictionary, it will run it through other criteria to output text.

For example, currently it is set up so that  
<span style="background-color:#f3e0c7; padding:2px 4px; border-radius:4px;">-FP</span>  
appends a period to the end of a word.

<span style="background-color:#f3e0c7; padding:2px 4px; border-radius:4px;">TKPWAEUFP</span> → gay.

However, this only works if the chord  
<span style="background-color:#f3e0c7; padding:2px 4px; border-radius:4px;">TKPWAEUFP</span>  
is not found in any dictionary.

Still a work in progress!
