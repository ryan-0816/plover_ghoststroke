Ghost Stroke is a plover plugin where if a certain stroke is not found in a dictionary, it will output something different.

For example, currently it is set up so that -FP appends a "." to the end of a word. TKPWAEUFP -> gay. 
However, this only works if the chord TKPWAEUFP is not found in any dictionary, and currently only works for single-word endings.

Still a work in progress!
